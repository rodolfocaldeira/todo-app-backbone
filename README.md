Little Big Todo App - Backbone
==============================

A simple todo app built using the following tools:

- [Jam.js](http://jamjs.org/) as the javascript package manager
- [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) dependency loader
- [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) as the MVC framework
- [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) as the build tool
- [Jasmine.js](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) as the testing framework

Yes, it definitely feels over engineered, but the goal was to try out a
different workflow, using the latest available tools.

You can check the application online in [here](http://rodolfocaldeira.com/labs/todo-app-backbone/).
